            <h1>Bubble Watch</h1>
            <p>
                Digital wristwatch using a HP bubble LED display and an Adafruit Feather M0. 
                Includes a 3D-printed case that fits most watch bands.

            <h2>Operation</h2>
            <img src="front.jpg" />
            <p>(Sorry, my phone doesn't handle glowy things very well.)<p>
            <p>
            The watch sleeps until you push the button. 
            It then cycles through the time, day, and date, then shuts off again.
            The battery lasts about 3-4 days between recharges.
            The time is set over the USB serial connection. 
            Send the time as a UTC Unix timestamp, such as with the command `date +%s`.
            </p>
            <p>
            The frimware is set for US Eastern Standard Time, and automatically adjusts to Daylight Savings for that timezone.
            To change the timezone, find this block:
            <pre>
//offset from UTC in hours, change as appropriate for your local timezone.
#define NORM_OFF -5
#define DST_OFF -4
            </pre>
            Replace the number next to NORM_OFF with the UTC offset for your timezone, 
            and the one next DST_OFF with the offset plus one. 
            For timezones that don't observe DST, or use different rules, 
            more changes may be necessary.
            </p>

            <h2>Parts</h2>
            <img src="disassembled.jpg" />
            <ul>
                <li>Adafruit Feather M0 basic proto</li>
                <li>(7) 330Ohm resistors, 1/4 or less (1/8 could make it more compact)</li>
                <li>HP QDSP-6064 4 digit seven segment LED display</li>
                <li>100mAh LiPo battery</li>
                <li>2-pin mini tac-switch</li>
                <li>replacement watch wristband with spring pins</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The resistors are connected in-line with the segment pins of the display. 
                The battery just connects to the JST socket on the board if you're using an Adafruit battery.
                To fit everything in the prototyping area took very careful soldering, and to solder the parts in a particular order. 
                I don't remeber what that order was, so good luck!

            <h2>3D Printing</h2>
            <img src="model.png" />
            <p>
                The model is saved in OpenSCAD format, and is in units of millimeters. 
                It should print without supports, and fits on a 100mmx100mm bed. 
                Mine was printed in black PLA on a PrintrBot Simple Maker Edition.
                The circuit board should press fit into the front of the case. 
                The back then presses into the front part and the pcb mounting holes.
